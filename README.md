# Ideas for Shopify developer careers page

Value software development as a professional trade.

Shopify is a software development company made by software developers who care a lot about quality of life.

This quality of life thing goes beyond creature-comfort perks. We define the term “company” along the lines of “a group of people who enjoy working together” and have found that investing in each others’ growth works out really well for everyone involved.

Shopify employs executive coaches like [Cameron Gregg](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/camgregg) who have open door policies to anyone in the company. If you’re curious about where your career is going or want to talk about something on your mind with someone in confidence who’s been in the industry for 25+ years, Cam is the guy.

Dev coaches like [Dave Rooney](ca.linkedin.com/in/daverooneyagile) act as technical debt/deployment safety ombudsmen. Deathmarches are bad. Working in a low-stress environment where you get meaningful feedback and can deploy without prayer is good.

- open source contributions
- no rewrites; lots of code deleted in Shopify 2

- Cam, Dave Rooney: dev quality of life matters. Technical debt and dev/deployment safety ombudsman + Exec coaching. Personal growth. There's more to this job and life than shipping fast and breaking things.
- Tobi and rest of company
-- CEO is still hacking and exploring new languages and tech + encouraging everyone to do so with him. Rest of company is made up of amazing people with wide range of backgrounds
- teams (name and list responsibilities)
- sponsorships (python, all girl hack night, pyladies, hacker you, ladies learning code, code for kids)
- encouragement to speak at conferences
- transparency and openness (this is not google; you can talk about your work) + access to financials and product
- cross functional teams; no comps from design thrown over the fence. Design comes with UX backing and in functional form with html+JS
- work closely with all parts of the product; bridging the gap
- hack days
- mobility in the company
- interview process is human
- opportunities for mentorship and mentoring; you will be working with fresh faces from university and industry veterans working on SmallTalk VMs before they were born. Heck, Tobi cut his teeth hacking assembly for game trainers for [german gaming company]. (Shout out to Tom's 2600 article if I can find it and a way to smoothly incorporate.)
- great culture: the attrition numbers speak for themselves
-- [# devs since 2006 hired]
-- [# devs gone in last year]
-- Number of times Shopify has been rewritten: Zero.
